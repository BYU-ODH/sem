* byu-odh/sem
A Clojure library designed to facilitate BYU semester and term operations, including arithmetic (like "20155 plus one is 20161"), getting the current year-term, and getting the starting and ending dates of a given year-term. 

Note that the "get" functions utilize the BYU Web Service APIs and so will require appropriate subscriptions.

** Usage
*** Include in leinengen
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[byu-odh/sem "1"]
#+END_SRC
*** sem.data for api calls (CLJ only)
You are expected to have a client id and secret as per https://api.byu.edu/store/site/pages/subscriptions.jag. 
To utilize the BYU services to get yt and yt-dates, you'll need to make sure the application for which you have the client (re: "Consumer" in BYU's current parlance) has subscriptions to the following:

[[https://api.byu.edu/store/apis/info?name=RecordsControlDates&version=v1&provider=BYU/mrg2][RecordsControlDates v1]]

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
 sem.data> (def opt-map {:client-id "<YOUR CLIENT-ID"
                         :client-secret "<YOUR CLIENT-SECRET>"})
 #'sem.data/opt-map
 sem.data> (get-yt opt-map)
 "20195"
 sem.data> (get-dates-yt (assoc opt-map :yt "20195")
 {:start-date #inst "2019-09-03T06:00:00.000-00:00", :year-term "20195", :end-date #inst "2019-12-19T07:00:00.000-00:00"}
 #+END_SRC

*** sem.core for arithmetic in CLJ or CLJS
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  sem.core> (add-yt "20191" -2)
  "20184"
  sem.core> (add-yt "20191" 4)
  "20201"
  sem.core> (dec-yt "20191")
  "20185"
  sem.core> (inc-yt "20195")
  "20201"
  sem.core> (gen-yt-text "20195")
  "Fall 2019"
  sem.core> (gen-yt-text "20192")
  "Spring+Summer 2019"
